The HTML document combines text, images, and links to provide an informative overview of space and related facts. 
However, it uses local paths for images and the favicon, which limits accessibility when viewed on the web. 
It is recommended to upload images to a web server and link them properly. 
Additionally, modern CSS should be used instead of deprecated HTML tags like <center>.
