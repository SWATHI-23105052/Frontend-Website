    <h2>5 Incredible Space Facts</h2>


    <h4>1. Space is completely silent.</h4>

    <p> There is no air or atmosphere in space. Since it is a vacuum, sound waves will have no medium to travel to. That means, no one will hear you scream in space, even if you shout the loudest!
    While sound waves (mechanical waves) need a medium to travel, radio waves (electromagnetic waves) can travel in the void of space. Astronauts use radios to stay in communication while in space since radio waves can still be sent and received in a vacuum environment.

    <h4>2. The hottest planet in our solar system is 450¬∞ C.</h4>

    <p>
        The hottest planet in the solar system is Venus. This scorching planet has an average surface temperature of about 232 ¬∞F (450 ¬∞C). Interestingly, Venus is not the closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is.
        Mercury has no atmosphere to regulate temperature so it has a very large temperature fluctuation. Venus, on the other hand, has the thickest atmosphere among all planets. This atmosphere traps heat, making Venus very hot.

    <h4>3. There may be life on Mars.</h4>

    <p>Of all the planets in our solar system (apart from Earth), Mars is the one most likely to be hospitable to life. In 1986, NASA found what they thought may be fossils of microscopic living things in a rock recovered from Mars.</p>
    
    
    <h4>4. Nobody knows how many stars are in space.</h4>
    <center><img src="D:\HTML\Projects\image copy 3.png" alt="image not found"></center>
    <p>The sheer size of space makes it impossible to accurately predict just how many stars we have. Right now, scientists and astronomers use the number of stars only within our galaxy, the Milky Way, to estimate.That number is between 200-400 billion stars and there are estimated to be billions of galaxies so the stars in space really are completely uncountable.

    <h4>5. Halleys Comet won‚Äôt orbit past Earth again until 2061.</h4>
    <center><img src="D:\HTML\Projects\image copy 4.png" alt="image not found"></center>
    <p>
        Discovered in 1705 by Edmond Halley, the famous comet was last seen in 1986 and is only seen once every 75 to 76 years.
